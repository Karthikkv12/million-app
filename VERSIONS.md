## v1.7.2 — Mobile & iPad Responsive Optimizations
**Released:** 2026-03-01
**Tag:** `v1.7.2`
**Branch:** `develop`

### 📱 Mobile (< 640px)
- Page header text scales down (`text-xl`); "Annual Summary" tab label truncates to "Annual" on phones
- `StatCard` font scales: `text-xl` phone → `text-2xl` sm+
- CC card header uses `flex-wrap` so the Charged/Paid/Due chips wrap instead of overflowing
- Free-add CC table has `min-w-[520px]` + `overflow-x-auto` for clean horizontal scroll
- Metrics stat cards: 2×2 grid on phone → 4-in-a-row at `sm` (640px)
- Tighter padding on metrics right panel (`px-3 py-3` on mobile)

### 📟 iPad / Tablet (`md` = 768px)
- Stat cards: `2col → 3col at md → 5col at lg` (no more jump from 2 to 5)
- Charts grid: `1col → 2col at md → 3col at lg`
- Robinhood Gold tracker: table + metrics side-by-side activates at `md` (iPad portrait) instead of `lg` (1024px only)
- Table left column narrows to `w-[320px]` on md, expands to `w-[360px]` on lg

## v1.7.1 — Robinhood Gold Tracker Improvements
**Released:** 2026-03-01
**Tag:** `v1.7.1`
**Branch:** `develop`

### 💳 Robinhood Gold Weekly Tracker — Fixes & UX
- **Fixed save error**: updating "Paid" in a fixed-week row no longer throws an error — `commitWeekRow` now calls `updateCCWeek` / `saveCCWeek` directly instead of routing through `saveMut` (which expected `CCDraft` string fields but received parsed numbers)
- **Column renames**: "Amount Charged" → **"Amount"**, "Paid from Trading" → **"Paid"** — cleaner, shorter labels
- **Note column removed** from fixed-week rows — not needed for the Robinhood Gold tracker
- **Side-by-side layout**: weekly input table (left, `360px`) + metrics/chart panel (right, flex-fill) in a `flex-row` layout at `lg` breakpoint — better use of horizontal space
- Metrics panel shows placeholder text ("Enter amounts to see metrics") when no data is entered yet
- Added `group-hover` reveal on delete buttons in fixed-week rows

---

## v1.7.0 — Budget Overrides, CC Tracker & Charts
**Released:** 2026-03-01
**Tag:** `v1.7.0`
**Branch:** `develop → main`

### 💳 Robinhood Credit Card Weekly Tracker
- Auto-generated Sun→Sat weekly spend slots for each month (4–5 rows based on calendar)
- No "Add Week" button — slots are fixed and always match the actual weeks of the month
- Inline editing with auto-save on blur per cell (amount, cashback)
- Running totals and month summary always visible

### 📊 CC Tracker Charts & Metrics
- **4 stat cards**: Total Spend, Total Cashback, Avg Weekly Spend, Cashback Rate %
- **Pay rate progress bar** — tracks spend vs. self-defined budget target
- **Weekly bar chart** — spend vs. cashback per week for the current month
- **Monthly trend line** — rolling view of spend across all logged months

### 🔄 Per-Month Budget Overrides for Recurring Entries
- Editing a recurring budget row **no longer changes the base value for all months**
- Each edit for a specific month saves a `BudgetOverride` record `(budget_id, month_key, amount)`
- Overridden rows display a **✎ indicator** with a tooltip showing the original base amount
- A **× reset button** on each overridden row reverts it back to the base amount instantly
- Stats, pie chart, and totals all reflect override amounts for the current month
- Deleting a base recurring entry cascades and removes all its overrides

### 🗄️ Backend
- `BudgetOverride` model + Alembic migration `0016` (`budget_overrides` table)
- `GET /budget-overrides`, `POST /budget-overrides` (upsert), `DELETE /budget-overrides/{id}`
- Cascade delete: removing a budget entry auto-removes all associated overrides
- `BudgetOverrideRequest` / `BudgetOverrideOut` Pydantic schemas

### 📐 Budget Page Enhancements
- **Annual Summary tab** — year-at-a-glance breakdown across all months
- **Trend chart** — spending trajectory over time
- **Savings rate widget** — income vs. spend ratio
- **Always-visible edit/delete buttons** on every row (no hover required)
- Full visual redesign: clean tables, stat cards, pie chart sidebar

## v1.6.7 — Week-over-Week Chart Overhaul
**Released:** 2026-02-28
**Tag:** `v1.6.7`
**Branch:** `develop → main`

### 📊 Week-over-Week Change Bar Chart
- Fixed bars becoming invisible (hairline thin) when 54 weeks of data are shown
- Each bar now has a **fixed 16px width** with `overflow-x-auto` horizontal scroll — all weeks always visible
- Container height increased from `h-24` (96px) → `h-52` (208px) for much taller, readable bars
- **Minimum 18% bar height** — bars never collapse to zero even on flat/zero-delta weeks
- **Auto-scale fallback**: when all deltas are < $50 (e.g. only 2 weeks logged), chart switches to account-value scale so bars are always meaningful
- Flat/zero-change weeks render as **slate-gray** bars (distinct from green gain / red loss)
- `maxChg` moved outside the `.map()` loop — no more O(n²) recalculation
- X-axis date labels shown for every Nth week (adaptive: 1, 2, 4, or 8 based on total count)
- Hover tooltip on each bar shows date + dollar value
- Legend updated to include Gain / Loss / Flat indicators

---

## v1.6.6 — iPad & Tablet Optimization
**Released:** 2026-02-28
**Tag:** `v1.6.6`
**Branch:** `develop → main`

### 📱 iPad / Tablet Layout (768px+)
- Sidebar now shown at `md` (768px) instead of `lg` (1024px)
  → iPad portrait and landscape both get the full sidebar, not hamburger menu
- Bottom nav hidden at `md+` — iPad uses sidebar navigation
- AI chat floating panel activates at `md+` — no fullscreen sheet on iPad
- AI chat FAB positioned at bottom-right on `md+`
- Viewport: `userScalable: true`, `maximumScale: 5` — pinch-zoom enabled on iPad
- Added `.touch-scroll` utility (`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`) on sidebar nav
- `tailwind.config.ts`: added `xs: 480px` breakpoint alias + screen size comments

---

## v1.6.5 — AI Chat Assistant (Gemini)
**Released:** 2026-02-28
**Tag:** `v1.6.5`
**Branch:** `develop → main`

### ✨ New Feature — OptionFlow AI Chat
- Floating AI assistant panel on every page (bottom-right corner)
- Powered by **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite** (free tier, no billing required)
- Live portfolio context injected automatically: positions, holdings, premium dashboard, account summary
- Per-position **✨ AI analysis** inline in the Positions tab
- Streaming responses with typing indicator
- Multi-key rotation: add `GEMINI_API_KEY_2/3` to `.env.local` for automatic quota failover
- Falls back to OpenAI if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set and Gemini quota is exhausted

### 🔧 Infrastructure Fixes
- Fixed `distDir` split that caused `middleware-manifest.json` 500 on every request
- Added `middleware.ts` to force pre-generation of `middleware-manifest.json`
- Added `error.tsx`, `global-error.tsx`, `app/(app)/error.tsx` error boundaries
- Fixed `npm start` script to include port (`-p 3002`)
- Added `start:fresh` script for clean build + start
- **Build rule documented:** always run `npm run build` in foreground (not `&`)

---

## v1.6.4 — Positions Metrics Overhaul
**Released:** 2026-02-28
**Tag:** `v1.6.4`
**Branch:** `develop → main`

### ✨ New Metrics — Per-Position Row
- **DTE (Days to Expiry)** — shown on every position row (mobile + desktop); color-coded urgency: 🔴 expired · 🟠 ≤3d · 🟡 ≤7d · gray >7d; mobile shows `"5d left"` / `"2d ago"`, desktop shows `"5d"`
- **Fix: /$1K formula** — `premium_in` is a per-share price; corrected formula to `(premium_in / strike) × 1000` (removed erroneous `/contracts` division from prior attempt)

### ✨ New KPI Cards — Positions Tab (8 cards total)
- **Stock Value at Stake** 🟡 — `sum(cost_basis × shares)` across all holdings with `X% covered` subtitle
- **Portfolio Value** 🟣 — `week.account_value` (e.g. $25K) for the current week
- **Portfolio Coverage** 🟠 — `total premium collected / portfolio value × 100` with progress bar (replaces old "Cost Basis Coverage" which only measured stock equity)
- **Capital at Risk** 🔴 — `sum(strike × contracts × 100)` for ACTIVE positions only; real strike obligation
- **In-Flight Premium** 🩵 — unrealized premium still open in active trades; subtitle shows locked/realized amount

### 🔧 Fixes
- **Cost Basis Coverage denominator** — now uses `week.account_value` (full $25K portfolio) not just stock holdings value
- **/$1K avg in KPI** — `avgPremPerK` also fixed to use `(premium_in / strike) × 1000` per position

---

## v1.6.3 — Positions Trade Metrics
**Released:** 2026-02-28
**Tag:** `v1.6.3`
**Branch:** `develop → main`

### ✨ New Features
- **Prem/$1K column** — premium collected per $1,000 of capital at risk, normalized to 1 contract (100 shares); comparable across strikes
- **ROI% column** — realized ROI for closed trades; unrealized income / capital at risk for active trades
- **Cost Basis Coverage KPI** — total all-time premium collected vs portfolio cost basis, with a mini progress bar
- **Avg Prem/$1K KPI** — average /$1K across this week's positions

---

## v1.6.2 — Mobile Pan Fix & Hide-on-Scroll Bottom Nav
**Released:** 2026-02-28
**Tag:** `v1.6.2`
**Branch:** `develop → main`

### 📱 Fixes
- **No more horizontal pan** — `AppShell` `<main>` and all 10 page root divs (`trades`, `dashboard`, `markets`, `budget`, `orders`, `accounts`, `ledger`, `settings`, `admin/users`, `options-flow`, `search`) now carry `w-full overflow-x-hidden`, eliminating horizontal scroll/pan on any narrow viewport
- **Hide-on-scroll bottom nav** — `BottomNav` listens to `window.scroll` (passive); slides off-screen with `translate-y-full` when scrolling down > 4 px, snaps back immediately on scroll up, and always reappears 300 ms after scroll stops — smooth `transition-transform duration-300`

---

## v1.6.1 — Mobile Responsive Overhaul
**Released:** 2026-02-28
**Tag:** `v1.6.1`
**Branch:** `develop`

### 📱 Mobile Optimizations
- **Scrollable tab bar** — `Tabs` component now horizontally scrolls on mobile with `scrollbar-none`; tabs are `whitespace-nowrap` with smaller padding at `< sm`
- **Positions table → mobile cards** — dual `sm:hidden` card / `hidden sm:block` table pattern; shows symbol, type badges, strike, contracts, dates, prem in/out, status select, and action buttons in a compact card layout
- **Holdings table → mobile cards** — symbol, shares, avg cost, live adjustment, premium badges, break-even prices, and live P&L all visible in card form
- **Symbols table → mobile cards** — symbol, total premium, realized P/L, active count, and status badges
- **Account tab table → mobile cards** — date, status badge, tappable inline-edit value, and delta/premium/realized P/L
- **YearTab stacked layout** — monthly chart and week-by-week table stack vertically (`flex-col sm:flex-row`) on mobile; week-by-week also uses mobile card list
- **PremiumTab by-symbol table** — proper `overflow-x-auto` scroll on narrow screens
- **Toolbar responsive labels** — HoldingsTab buttons abbreviated on mobile ("Sync", "Import", "Add") with `hidden sm:inline` full labels on desktop
- **Action bar flex-wrap** — PositionsTab action buttons wrap on small screens; "Mark Week Complete" abbreviated to "Complete" on mobile
- **WeekSelector** — select stretches full width on mobile (`flex-1`), button is `shrink-0`
- **`.scrollbar-none` CSS utility** — added to `globals.css` (hides scrollbar cross-browser)
- **`HoldingLivePriceMobile`** — new inline component (no `<td>` wrapper) for mobile card live price display

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- **Dashboard build error** — fixed pre-existing TypeScript error: Recharts `formatter` prop now correctly typed as `(v: number | undefined) => [string, string]`

---

## v1.6.0 — Positions Prem Out, Account Tab, Dashboard Balance Chart
**Released:** 2026-02-27  
**Tag:** `v1.6.0`  
**Branch:** `develop`

### ✨ New Features
- **Account Value tab** — weekly Friday account value tracker with KPI cards, SVG line/area chart, week-over-week delta bars, and inline editable table
- **Dashboard portfolio balance chart** — weekly balance area chart with KPI (current value, total growth %) linked to Account tab; shows placeholder when only 1 data point
- **Inline Prem Out on status change** — selecting CLOSED / EXPIRED / ROLLED on a position now reveals an inline prem-out input + live net P&L preview (green profit / red LOSS badge) without opening the edit form
- **Prem Out column** — "Roll" column renamed to "Prem Out"; shows buyback cost for all closed/expired/assigned/rolled positions with net P&L and LOSS badge when buyback exceeds collected
- **Loss cap on adj basis** — closing a position at a loss (buyback > collected) caps `realized_premium` at 0; losses never reduce `adj_basis`

### 🏗 UX / Nav
- **Tab reorder** — Account tab is now default; order: Account → Holdings → Positions → Activity → Premium → Performance
- **Nav cleanup** — Orders, Accounts, Ledger shelved from navbar (commented, not deleted)
- **Page title** — "Options Portfolio" renamed to "Portfolio"
- **Dashboard cleanup** — Removed Realized P/L, Cash, and Positions stat cards from dashboard

### 🔧 Infrastructure
- **Build/dev cache isolation** — `next.config.mjs` now uses `distDir: ".next-build"` for production builds so `npm run build` never overwrites the dev server's `.next` cache
- **`dev:clean` script** — added `npm run dev:clean` (wipes `.next` then starts dev)
- **VS Code auto-start task** — `.vscode/tasks.json` kills stale port-3000/3002 processes and starts the dev server automatically on workspace open
- **`scripts/dev.sh` port fix** — changed default `WEB_PORT` from 3000 → 3002

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Stale dev server on wrong port** — `scripts/dev.sh` was hardcoded to port 3000; fixed
- **`_compute_premiums` 3-tuple** — updated function signature and all callers to return `(realized, unrealized, close_loss)`

---

## v1.5.0 — Performance Charts, Holdings & Monthly Premium
**Released:** 2026-02-27
**Tag:** `v1.5.0`
**Branch:** `main` (production)

### ✨ New Features
- **Performance tab** — accumulation curve, projection, and basis reduction charts per position; tabs renamed Symbols→Activity, Year→Performance
- **Monthly premium chart** — shows all 12 months of premium collected with a line graph overlay
- **Holdings tab** — stock holdings with ticker search, company name, live price, unrealized P&L, and cost basis tracking; seeded automatically from positions (strike → avg cost, holding_id linked)
- **Carry-forward positions** — open positions automatically carried into the current week view
- **Live adj basis** — live adjusted basis + upside/downside from linked positions
- **Re-open completed week** — ability to re-open a completed week for further editing
- **Year summary tab** — yearly summary with weekly breakdown
- **Weekly options portfolio UI** — full weekly portfolio management interface
- **Notation key on Premium tab** — legend added to bottom of Premium tab

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Adj basis not reverting** — fixed adj basis not reverting when a position is flipped back to ACTIVE
- **Fallback for live_adj_basis** — added fallback for `live_adj_basis` undefined on stale cache responses
- **Edit/delete positions on completed weeks** — fixed editing and deleting positions on completed weeks; added delete confirmation dialog
- **Duplicate import build error** — removed duplicate `fetchStockHistory` import causing Next.js build failure

### 🧪 Tests
- **Portfolio service** — 23/23 tests passing after bug fixes
- **GEX sweep** — 31-symbol GEX sweep + API endpoint tests + pre-release CI gate
- **GEX unit tests** — GEX unit tests + GitHub Actions CI workflow

---

## v1.4.0 — Premium Ledger Fix & Premium Tab
**Released:** 2026-02-27
**Tag:** `v1.4.0`
**Branch:** `main` (production)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Adj basis double-counting** — `sync_ledger_from_positions()` was creating a `PremiumLedger` row for both original positions *and* their carry-forward copies (positions created when completing a week, with `carried_from_id` set). This doubled every premium figure (e.g. $487 appeared as $974). Fix: added `carried_from_id == None` filter so only originals get ledger rows. `upsert_ledger_row()` also updated to redirect any carry-forward call to the original position's row. Stale carry-forward rows deleted from DB (14 → 7 rows)

### ✨ New Features
- **Premium tab** (`Trades → Premium`) — full breakdown of all collected premium:
  - **3 stat cards** — Total Collected · Realized (locked in, closed/expired options) · In-Flight (active options, settles on close/expiry)
  - **By-symbol table** — Avg Cost · Adj Basis (stored) · Live Adj Basis · Sold $ · Realized $ · In-Flight $ · # Positions, with a footer total row and a Sync Ledger button
  - **By-week section** — collapsible rows per week showing per-symbol premium breakdown
  - **Legend** explaining realized vs in-flight distinction
- **`GET /portfolio/premium-dashboard`** — new API endpoint powering the tab; returns `by_symbol`, `by_week`, and `grand_total`
- **`fetchPremiumDashboard`** + TypeScript types (`PremiumDashboard`, `PremiumSymbolRow`, `PremiumWeekRow`) added to `web/lib/api.ts`

### 📊 Correct Data After Fix
| Symbol | Sold | Live Adj |
|--------|------|----------|
| SMCI   | $109 | $31.20   |
| BMNR   | $85  | $18.11   |
| BBAI   | $66  | $3.65    |
| SMR    | $65  | $12.12   |
| HIMS   | $59  | $14.24   |
| TSLL   | $58  | $13.90   |
| SOFI   | $45  | $16.89   |
| **Total** | **$487** | — |

## v1.3.1 — GEX Accuracy Fix & Test Suite Green
**Released:** 2026-02-27
**Tag:** `v1.3.1`
**Branch:** `main` (production)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **GEX phantom rows (QQQ -$160B → $5.76B)** — yfinance returns `IV = 1e-5` (0.001%) as a floor placeholder for illiquid options with zero bid/ask. Feeding this to Black-Scholes caused `gamma` to explode to ~55 (vs ~0.025 for a real ATM option) because the denominator `S × σ × √T → 0`. Fix: skip any row where `iv < 0.5%` and `mid == 0` in `_parse_chain_rows`; also add a hard `sigma < 0.005` guard in `bs_gamma` as defence-in-depth
- **3 failing auth tests** — `authenticate_user()` was updated to return `{'user_id': int, 'role': str}` but three test assertions still compared it to a bare integer. Updated `test_create_and_auth`, `test_change_password`, and `test_password_policy_enforced_on_change_password` to use `result['user_id']`

### ✅ Test Suite
- **33/33 tests pass** (was 30/33)

---

## v1.3.0 — Scroll Fix, Dev Tooling & Startup Guide
**Released:** 2026-02-27
**Tag:** `v1.3.0`
**Branch:** `main` (production)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Scroll broken on Chrome/Windows** — root cause was `overflow-x: hidden/clip` on `<html>`/`<body>`, which Chrome uses to hijack the scroll container, making mousewheel scroll non-functional. Fixed by moving horizontal overflow control to `#__next` wrapper only; `html` and `body` are now overflow-clean
- **Scroll broken on macOS** — removed `overflow-x-hidden` from AppShell wrapper div and `<body>` className that were blocking scroll event delegation
- **Mobile sidebar not scrollable** — added `overflow-hidden` bound + `overscroll-contain` + `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` to the mobile drawer panel and nav list
- **Desktop sidebar nav** — added `overscroll-contain` so sidebar scroll doesn't bleed into page scroll
- **Scrollbar too thin for mouse users (Windows)** — increased from 4px to 8px with a visible track; added Firefox `scrollbar-width` + `scrollbar-color` support

### 🔧 Developer Experience
- **Startup checklist** added to `DEV_GUIDE.md` — step-by-step guide (8 steps) for after every reboot/new session, covering git branch check, pull, backend start, port 3000, port 3002, sanity check table
- **Restart commands** section added — individual and combined one-liners for restarting backend, port 3000, port 3002, or all three at once
- **Launchd agent fix** — `com.optflw.nextjs` plist was pointing at `OptionFlow_V1/web` instead of `OptionFlow_main/web`; corrected `~/bin/optflw-nextjs.sh` and reloaded agent

---

## v1.2.0 — GEX Components, UI Polish & Mobile Responsiveness
**Released:** 2026-02-25
**Branch:** `develop`

### ✨ New Features
- **5 new standalone GEX/flow components** in `web/components/options-flow/`:
  - `GexProfileChart` — horizontal bar chart of call (green) vs put (red) GEX by strike
  - `GammaConcentration` — horizontal bar chart of total |GEX| per strike across all expiries
  - `FlowMomentumChart` — time-series net flow with 1D/3D/7D/14D day selector
  - `DealerNarrative` — plain-English interpretation of GEX regime
  - `KeyLevelsRuler` — visual pin ruler: Put Wall → Zero γ → Spot → Call Wall
- **GEX strike heatmap promoted to top** of GEX tab — primary component is now first
- **Isolated 3002 sandbox** — `OptionFlow_main/web` runs on port 3002, separate from stable 3000

### 🎨 Design & UX
- `GexKeyLevels`: all 5 pills use red/green only; Zero-γ logic: above spot = red, below = green
- `GexStrikeTable`: spot row = black bg + white text, legend footer added, vertical scroll removed
- All nav/auth/landing purple accents replaced with neutral system colors
- `BottomNav`: neutral active state (no blue)
- Login page: neutral badge, focus rings, submit button
- Options Flow page: neutral activity badge and add button

### 📱 Mobile Responsiveness
- `GexKeyLevels`: `grid-cols-2` on mobile, `sm:grid-cols-5`
- `GexStrikeTable`: summary header wraps on mobile; Regime/Zero-γ columns hidden on small screens
- `TickerPanel`: GEX section header flex-wraps on mobile
- `PanelHeader`: tighter gap on mobile
- Viewport meta: `width=device-width, initial-scale=1`, no user scaling
- `html` + `body` + app layout: `overflow-x: hidden` at all levels (no horizontal pan)
- Body: removed hardcoded `bg-white dark:bg-gray-950` (uses CSS vars)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- `StockInfo.company_name` → `name` (field rename fix in stock sheet page)
- `GexProfileChart` Recharts Tooltip formatter — `any` cast to fix strict TypeScript type error
- `Navbar`: fixed corrupted `className` (stray `nter>` fragment) in collapsed/mobile avatars
- `Navbar`: logout now redirects to `/` (welcome page) instead of `/login`
- App layout: unauthenticated guard redirects to `/`
- Launchd service `com.optflw.nextjs` discovered and documented — manages port 3000 auto-restart

### 🔧 Internal
- `web/components/options-flow/index.ts` barrel exports all 5 new components
- `OptionFlow_main/web` synced as isolated sandbox for UI experimentation (port 3002)

## v1.1.0 — TradingView Chart + Search Page Overhaul
**Released:** 2025-02-25  
**Commit:** `c60cfbc`  
**Tag:** `v1.1.0`  
**Branch:** `main` (production)

### ✨ New Features
- **TradingView-style interactive chart** (`web/components/chart/TradingChart.tsx`)
  - Built on `lightweight-charts v5.1.0` — professional-grade financial charting
  - **Candlestick / Line** toggle for price display mode
  - **Volume histogram** rendered on a separate price scale below the main chart
  - **SMA overlays** — 20, 50, and 200-day moving averages, independently toggleable
  - **Period selector** — 1D · 5D · 1M · 3M · 6M · 1Y · 5Y (fetches correct OHLCV window per selection)
  - **Earnings marker** — triangular `▲` marker rendered directly on the date of the next earnings event
  - **GEX price lines** — horizontal lines for Call Wall (green), Put Wall (red), and Zero Gamma (amber), sourced from live GEX calculation
  - **OHLCV crosshair legend** — floating O/H/L/C/V values update in real-time as the cursor moves
  - **ResizeObserver** — chart reflows cleanly when the panel or viewport is resized
  - **Dark mode aware** — chart background and grid match the app's neutral dark theme
- **Earnings banner** on the Overview tab — amber callout showing "Next Earnings: [date] · in N days"

### 🎨 Design
- **Full neutral retheme of the stock search page** (`web/app/(app)/search/page.tsx`)
  - All purple/violet accent colors removed; replaced with `var(--foreground)` neutral system
  - All tabs, buttons, badges, section headers, and flow momentum indicators rethemed
  - Consistent with the v1.0.0 app-wide neutral palette

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- `gexLevels` null → undefined coercion (`?? undefined`) to fix TypeScript strict null check
- `UTCTimestamp` branded type from `lightweight-charts` — fixed with `import type { UTCTimestamp }` and `as unknown as UTCTimestamp` cast
- Stale Node.js process on port 3000 causing Internal Server Error on `/search` — documented and resolved

### 🔧 Internal
- Removed unused `useRef`, `QuoteBar`, `LineChart`, `PERIOD_CFG`, `PriceTooltip` from search page after chart refactor
- `PriceChartPanel` is now a thin wrapper that delegates to `TradingChart` — keeps backward-compatible prop API

---

## v1.0.0 — Stable Foundation
**Released:** 2025-02-25  
**Commit:** `c5aee82`  
**Tag:** `v1.0.0`  
**Branch:** `main`

### ✨ New Features
- **GEX formula corrected to canonical standard** (SpotGamma / Perfiliev)
  - Full formula: `gamma × OI × lot_size × spot² × 0.01`
  - Sign convention: calls = positive GEX, puts = negative GEX (dealer perspective)
  - Time parameter: `T = max(T_days, 1) / 252.0` (trading days, not calendar)
  - Previous implementation was missing the `spot² × 0.01` scaling factor and had inverted put sign
- **King node fixed** in GEX Strike Table
  - Star glyph now renders in amber (`#f59e0b`) — was previously invisible black-on-dark
  - King is now computed from visible/displayed strikes only (not the full dataset)
  - `kingMap` computed with `useMemo` to avoid redundant recalculation
  - Fixed duplicate `const isKing` declaration that caused a build error

### 🎨 Design
- **App-wide neutral retheme** — all purple, violet, and blue gradient accents removed
- Design tokens use `var(--foreground)` / `var(--background)` throughout
- **Mobile responsiveness** — fixed horizontal overflow (`overflow-x: hidden`), corrected `viewport` meta tag
- Navbar logout button now correctly redirects to `/` instead of `/login`
- Auth guard redirects unauthenticated users to `/` (landing page) instead of `/login`

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- GEX heatmap `[si][ei]` axis order corrected to `[ei][si]`
- King star size increased and color fixed for visibility across all heatmap cell backgrounds

                                                              ↓
                                                         git tag vX.Y.Z
```

- **`feat/*`** — All new features and non-trivial fixes
- **`develop`** — Integration branch; staging state
- **`main`** — Production only; never committed to directly
- Tags are applied to `main` commits only, after explicit release approval
